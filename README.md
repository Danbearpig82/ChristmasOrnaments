# ChristmasOrnaments

On load, will create a fake player that will keep track of the game tick in order to randomize when ornaments will sparkle. Run /function ct_ornaments:give_ornaments to give yourself a stack of each Christmas tree ornament. These are custom spawn eggs that will spawn invisible armor stands with Christmas ornament heads and position them so they will sit on the block you are targeting. Each ornament will sparkle once every six seconds starting on a randomized tick. If the randomization doesn't look good to you, randomize all existing ornament timings with function ct_ornaments:randomize_sparkle. To remove all ornaments, run function ct_ornaments:remove_ornaments.
